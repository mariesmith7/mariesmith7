👋 Hi, I'm Marie Smith! I prefer to go by my first/middle name, Marie Carmel.

👀 I have a passion for art, painting, digital & web design, and I love spending time traveling, outdoors hiking, fishing, and exploring nature.

🌱 Currently, I'm learning Full Stack Development and expanding my skills in web applications.

⚡ Fun fact: I once earned the nickname Dr. Dolittle for having three dogs, a cat, two birds, a turtle, a hamster, and an aquarium!

When I'm not coding or designing, you can find me solving puzzles, roller skating, playing dominoes & sudoku, and traveling!
